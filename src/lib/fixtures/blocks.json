One faction of the Bitcoin community, the Big Blockers, wanted to increase the maximum size of each block, from 1 megabyte to something higher like 32 megabytes. This increase would allow many more transactions to fit in each block, which means much higher transaction throughput for the Bitcoin blockchain. This would help scale Bitcoin to handle more users and payments. Major companies such as exchanges and miners wanted this change as it would be good for their businesses.</div><div class='mb-4'>However, a second-order effect of increasing block size is that fewer individuals would be able to run full nodes when storage and bandwidth requirements go up 32 times. Control over the network would then centralize to the companies that can afford massive servers and make it more likely that other rules will change in the future. So the full node operators, many of whom were using cheap desktop computers, defeated the big companies and prevented the block size increase.</div><div class='mb-4'>In response, the Big Blockers hardforked Bitcoin at the end of 2017 to create a new blockchain and token, called Bitcoin Cash, which had 32 megabytes per block. At the time of the hardfork, everyone who owned Bitcoin also owned the same number of Bitcoin Cash, and then the two blockchains diverged. Since then, Bitcoin Cash has lost over 95% of its market value and mining hashpower compared to Bitcoin, showing the importance of using a bigger and more secure network. As of July 2024, the Bitcoin blockchain is just over 500 gigabytes, which means individuals can still easily run a full node with an affordable computer.</div>"

Once your real identity is linked to a bitcoin address, then you can be tracked on the blockchain if you use that address. One way to mitigate this privacy risk is to generate and use a new address for receiving each new transaction so that your BTC from different transactions stay on different addresses. This is why Proton Wallet automatically rotates addresses when you receive Bitcoin via Email. These address segregations become harder to manage when you have to send BTC, which may combine different addresses to fund the transaction if one address does not have enough BTC.</div><div class='mb-4'>Coinjoin is considered the best solution for improving blockchain privacy. It works by mixing your BTC with other users' BTC in a collaborative self-custodial transaction where you get back the same amount of BTC that you put in but on a different address that cannot be easily linked to your previous address. However, in 2024, in what many consider to be a regulatory overreach and attack on privacy, some of these Coinjoin services have been declared illegal in the US and EU.

First, it allows for instant settlement instead of waiting for 10-minute blocks to confirm. Second, it is more private because transactions are not saved to the blockchain forever. Finally, it tends to have lower transaction fees by avoiding onchain network fees for most transactions. All these advantages make Lightning better for Bitcoin payments.</div><div class='mb-4'>The challenge with Lightning is that self-custodial wallets, where each user runs a node that has their BTC in payment channels, is quite complex to operate. It also requires each user to pay at least one onchain fee to open a channel and potentially more onchain fees later to add or remove funds from the channel. As onchain fees increase, self-custodial Lightning will also be unaffordable for more and more individuals.</div><div class='mb-4'>This is why most Lightning users are on custodial wallets and rely on centralized services to manage the complexity and fees with economies of scale. At this point, Lightning looks more suitable for custodial services to transact with each other and not for the masses to use in a self-sovereign way.</div>"

The tokens of these alternative networks are known as altcoins. Some of these altcoins tried to improve on Bitcoin, such as by increasing the blocksize as discussed with Bitcoin Cash. Others were simply ponzi schemes pumped up by individuals looking to defraud people who didn't understand the difference, leading to the term “shitcoins”.</div><div class='mb-4'>Many altcoins were pre-mined by their creators, who got a large fraction of the tokens, before launching to the general public. The creators of these altcoins were then extremely financially motivated to market their coins. Most altcoins were centrally controlled and quickly changed, in contrast to Bitcoin, which by design has been incredibly difficult to change. This proliferation of altcoins and other unsustainable businesses became known as “crypto” and has taken attention and market share away from Bitcoin. Most of these altcoins provided no value to the world, could not find market fit, and collapsed, causing millions of individuals to lose billions.</div><div class='mb-4'>The key things that differentiate Bitcoin are the network and protocol. Bitcoin has the largest network and its network effect draws in more users, further increasing its utility as a global monetary network and the value of BTC. Altcoins simply cannot compete even if they have some perceived advantages such as higher throughput or privacy. As more merchants and consumers around the world adopt Bitcoin, the network effect should continue to strengthen.</div><div class='mb-4'>Bitcoin is also a digital protocol for money on the internet, and with protocols, it's almost always winner-takes-all. In the early decades of the internet, there were the Protocol Wars and eventually the world converged to use the same protocols to communicate. For example, we all use TCP/IP to send traffic over the internet, we all use HTTP to browse the web, and we all use SMTP to send emails. Bitcoin, and its higher layers such as the Lightning Network, is currently the dominant open protocol for sending value on the internet.</div>"
