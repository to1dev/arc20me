Once a miner succeeds in the computational challenge before other miners, it tells other full nodes, which verify if the miner followed all the rules. If yes, each full node then adds the valid block to its copy of the blockchain and tells other full nodes, until the network reaches consensus. The miner that solved the PoW challenge for the new block gets some new bitcoins as a reward for their computational contribution. Miners basically convert computing power into new bitcoins and secure the network from attacks. On average, a new block is added every 10 minutes and each block can contain thousands of transactions. A difficulty adjustment on mining happens every 2,016 blocks to try to maintain the 10 minute tempo."

To send BTC to another address, they use the private key to sign the transaction. Thus, whoever owns the private key owns the associated BTC. Users can either trust third-party services like exchanges to hold their bitcoin, or use a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet like Proton Wallet to store the key themselves. When users want their transactions added to the blockchain, they will often pay transaction fees that go to the miners as another incentive to include their transaction. This network fee goes up when there is more demand for Bitcoin transactions."
